One theme for Jekyll
================
"One" is a [Liquid](http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a simple, static blog-aware static site generator. It focuses on featuring a single-author blog layout. Focus on your writing and let Jekyll and One handle the rest!

Use it with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)!

Prerequisites
-------------
It is essential that you have these prerequisites installed to use this theme.

- [Git](https://github.com/): the version control system (*duh*)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/): the programming language
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com): the simple static site generator written in Ruby


Notice
-------
This theme is a side project. No fancy features and no bullshit. It shows only the most basic metadata a post has and nothing else. And of course, it exhibits the narcissistic you!


How to use this theme
----------------------
First, learn and understand what Jekyll does. The rest should be as easy as simply cloning this repo.

```
cd /path/to/workspace/
git clone https://github.com/william8th/jekyll-one-theme.git
cd jekyll-one-theme
jekyll serve
```

Jekyll would listen to port 4000 by default. Typically, if you're hosting this theme on your local machine, just visit http://localhost:4000 and your browser will bring you to your page showing the theme.

If you face any problems when using the `jekyll` command, try referring to the prerequisites mentioned above.
